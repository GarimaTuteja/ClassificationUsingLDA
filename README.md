Following is the overview of what has been done in the project

1. Identified top 10 predictors for which the difference between the spam-class average and non- spam class average is highest
2. Used linear discriminant analysis to build this classifier
3. Evaluated effectiveness of model using confusion matrix, lift chart and decile chart
